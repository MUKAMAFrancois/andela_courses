    <!-- CSS Variables (Custom Properties):
Introduction:
CSS Variables, also known as Custom Properties, are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. They bring the benefits of modularity and maintainability to your stylesheets.

Declaration and Usage:
To declare a CSS variable, you use the -- prefix followed by the variable name: -->


<!-- Scope:
CSS Variables are scoped to the element they are defined on. 
The :root selector is commonly used to define global variables 
applicable to the entire document. -->


<!-- Dynamic Values:
CSS Variables allow dynamic values. You can change a variable's value using JavaScript,
 providing a powerful way to update styles dynamically. 

:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}

.dark-mode {
  --primary-color: #2c3e50;
}
In this example, when an element with the class dark-mode 
is present, it dynamically changes the --primary-color variable.
